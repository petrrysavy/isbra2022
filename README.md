An Algorithm to Calculate the $p$-value of the Monge-Elkan Distance
TODO: provide a reference when available

The paper was presented at ISBRA 2022 (https://mangul-lab-usc.github.io/ISBRA)
and is intended for the following special issue.

All source codes are implemented in Java programming language. To run the project,
